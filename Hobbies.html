<h1>SPORTS</h1>
<p >The cheerfullness to play football and cricket is just because of my school friends.
  <br />Whenever there is reunion of my friends,we used to play football for sure.<br />
  I usually watch cricket match rather than playing it.<br />Talking about some indoor games
          <br />  I play <i> CHESS , CARROM,TABLE TENNIS,LUDO</i> and many more.

  </p>
  <h1>LISTENING MUSIC</h1>
  <p>I am not that music-addict person.<br />I do listen to music to relax and get chilled.<br />
    I too get lost in the music composed by <EM>ARJIT SINGH</EM> <br />The King of playback singing of India.

    <h1>Watching Stand Up Comedy</h1>
    <p>
      This the most part that I want to share.<br />Most of the Indian Comedians are Engineers by profession.
      <br />The most renowned and hallowed comedian <Em>ZAKHIR KHAN</Em><br /> has a big fan following including me.
      <br />I actually don't do this kind of stuff , <br />but enjoy watching comedians performing their events.
